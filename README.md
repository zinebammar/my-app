In this repo, you'll find a quick and easy app to get started using [
Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/) with [GitHub](https://
github.com/).
## Version Control Workflow
Once multiple people are collaborating on Terraform configuration, new
steps must be added to the core Terraform workflow (Write, Plan, Apply)
to ensure everyone is working together smoothly. In order for
different teams and individuals to be able to work on the same
Terraform code, you need to use a Version Control System (VCS). The
Terraform Cloud VCS or version control system workflow includes the
most common steps necessary to work in a collaborative nature, but it
also requires that you host the Terraform code in a VCS repository.
Events on the repository will trigger workflows on Terraform Cloud. For
instance, a commit to the default branch could kick off a plan and
apply workflow in Terraform Cloud.
